Code issues:

  1. Loops:
    - [x] clearBoard()
    - [ ] endTurnX()
    - [ ] placeX()
    - [ ] endTurnO()
    - [ ] placeO()
    - [ ] boardState() :
        a. var square[i]
        b. XisEqual() calls
        c. OisEqual() calls

  2. Assign var to X and O and have it switch on and off

  3. Stylize alert boxes (or have div show?)

  4. Fix when someone wins twice

  5. Prevent click to change current piece on board

  7. Have win alert come after placement of piece


Other To Do:

  1. Project Docs

  2. Deploy on surge

  3. Push to GH
