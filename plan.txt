Tic-Tac-Toe

- Two players take turns placing an X or an O on a 3x3 board
- When one player has three in a row, they win
- If the board fills up with no three in a row, it is a tie


Need to:

- Collect Player 1 and Player 2 names and assign them to either X or O
- Build a board using CSS and HTML (flex divs with borders?)
- Use event listeners to figure out if there are 3 X's or O's on the board in a row
- If no winner declared after 9 turns, announce tie
- Ask if they want to play again and reset the board


To do:
- Build board
- Write JS logic
- Make it pretty
- Deploy (surge?)
- Write docs


clean up:
- loops for repeat offenders
- set var for turn, change var instead of calling PlaceO or placeX

Game play:

1. Start with empty board
2. Player One can add an X anywhere on the board
3. Player Two can add an O in any empty spot
4. Repeat until there is a winner (3 in a row) or board is full (9 turns)
5. Announce winner or tie
6. Reset board
