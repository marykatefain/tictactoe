Web Developer Applicant Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

A big hello from Passyunk Ave in the heart of South Philadelphia. This project is a way for us to get to know you and your general development practices. Below, we'll lay out the high-level requirements and the project-specific requirements for you.

High-Level Requirements

- Deploy the project live for us in some fashion. Github pages is fine if you're just building a front-end application. Heroku or a VPS provider like Linode or Digital Ocean is probably a safe bet for a server-side application, but it's your choice.
- Document the following things for us in a write-up:
A general description of your project
- Instructions for cloning and running the project
- Any interesting technical decisions you made along the way
- What you might have done additionally given more time

Technical Requirements

- You may use universal libraries like jQuery, lodash and async, but please refrain from using any jQuery plugins or similar. We want to see how you solve the kinds of problems that might otherwise be canned in a "slideshow plugin," for instance.
We don't currently make heavy use any of the major front-end frameworks like Angular or React. If you end up using one of these, please include your reasoning in the write-up of your technical decisions.
- Refrain from using any images. Use HTML and CSS or the canvas to create any shapes or symbols.
- We're interested in your design sensibilities, so make sure to spend some time on the styles.
- Project Specific Requirements

For this project, we'd like you to build a tic-tac-toe game in the browser. Here are the general requirements:

- Game should be locally turn-based (i.e. two players playing at the same computer).
- User will be notified when there is a winner, following the traditional rules of tic-tac-toe.
- Users should be able to reset the game board at any point.
- Include instructions for your users on how to interact with the game.

Bonus Points

These are strictly extra-credit, so make sure you've cleared the basic scope of the game before moving on to these:

- Single player can play against the computer
- Storing of game details so that user can return to game later.
- Remote playing between two players.
